Specializing in Full Stack Development, I excel in the creation of responsive and dynamic websites.

My professional journey encompasses a valuable internship at Highradius and a fulfilling tenure at the startup "Swirl." In these roles, I served as both an individual contributor and later as the Head of a pod, navigating a dynamic and fast-paced agile environment. These experiences have endowed me with versatile skills applicable to companies of varying scales.
